        <h3>First Song From Sorting Hat</h3>                           <!--Header three and four are created-->
        <h4>All Credits and Rights Reserved for J.K.Rowling</h4>
        <p>                                                            <!--This is the creation of many paragraphs.-->
            "Oh, you may not think I'm pretty,
            But don't judge on what you see,
            I'll eat myself if you can find
            A smarter hat than me.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can keep your bowlers black,
            Your top hats sleek and tall,
            For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat
            And I can cap them all.
        </p>
        <p>
            There's nothing hidden in your head
            The Sorting Hat can't see,
            So try me on and I will tell you
            Where you ought to be.
        </p>
        <p>
            You might belong in Gryffindor,
            Where dwell the brave at heart,
            Their daring, nerve and chivalry,
            Set Gryffindors apart;
        </p>
        <p>
            You might belong in Hufflepuff
            Where they are just and loyal,
            Those patient Hufflepuffs are true,
            And unafraid of toil;
        </p>
        <p>
            Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,
            If you've a ready mind,
            Where those of wit and learning,
            Will always find their kind;
        </p>
        <p>
            Or perhaps in Slytherin,
            You'll make your real friends,
            Those cunning folk use any means,
            To achieve their ends.
        </p>
        <p>
            So put me on! Don't be afraid!
            And don't get in a flap!
            You're in safe hands (though I have none)
            For I'm a Thinking Cap!"
